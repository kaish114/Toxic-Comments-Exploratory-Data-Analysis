##Introduction

Some times people say nasty things over the internet because they feel anonymous there. So lets filter out some hate.

##Objective

I am going to perform Exploratory data analysis for toxic comment classification

##Dataset

The dataset here is from wiki corpus dataset which was rated by human raters for toxicity. The corpus contains 63M comments from discussions relating to user pages and articles dating from 2004-2015.

Different platforms/sites can have different standards for their toxic screening process. Hence the comments are tagged in the following five categories

    toxic
    severe_toxic
    obscene
    threat
    insult
    identity_hate
